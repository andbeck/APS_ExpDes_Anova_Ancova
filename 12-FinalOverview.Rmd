# A final Overview    

In this set of chapters, you've learned about 

- the basics of experimental design, including
  - Randomisation, replication and reducing error
  - Confounding, placebos and blinding
  - bias and systematic error
  - the standard error
- the use of agricolae to
  - build an understanding of different experimental designs, such as the
    - completely randomised designs
    - randomised block designs
    - the latin square design
  - create data that represent a variety of effects of treatments on response variables.
    - including additive effects, block effects and interactions
  - analyse these data using our workflow of plot, model, diagnostics, inference
- develop a deep understanding of the 2-way ANOVA and the ANCOVA
- develop an understanding of regression modelling 

I come back to one of the central ideas in chapter 2 to finish.

Experiments help us answer questions, but there are also non-experimental techniques. What is so special about experiments? 

1. Experiments allow us to set up a direct comparison between the treatments of interest.
2. We can design experiments to minimize any bias in the comparison.
3. We can design experiments so that the error in the comparison is small.
4. Most important, we are in control of experiments, and having that control allows us to make stronger inferences about the nature of differences
that we see in the experiment. Specifically, we may make inferences about causation.

This last point distinguishes an experiment from an observational study. In an observational study we merely observe which units are in which treatment groups; we donâ€™t get to control that assignment.  This underpins the classic issue with assigning _causation to correlation_ - in the following two examples, there is a strong association between the variables, but there has been no control/manipulation.
