# The Latin Square Design (LSD)

Sometimes you will have two sources of variation in space or time, or perhaps space and time.  Perhaps there is a gradient of elevation up and down a hillside, and a gradient of sun incidence orthoganol (90Ëš) to that.  There are innumerable examples one could imagine.  The principle is that in an LSD, the treatments are allocated randomly in 'rows' and 'columns'.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/lsd.png")
```

A Latin Square blocks on both rows and columns simultaneously. 

Agricolae has a built in function for helping generate these designs, obvio.  Again, new section or new script.....

```{r}
# makes sure random allocation happens the same for everyone.
set.seed(123)

#
treat<- c("Cont","Herb1","Herb2","Placebo")

# design.lsd
design <- design.lsd(treat,serie = 0)$book
design
```

Make sure you understand that the double-blocking has happened!  See the figure above with 4 letters.  Can you create on a piece of paper the matrix from this design you've made in R?

Now, lets generate some data, as before.

```{r}
# for fun, set again.
set.seed(123)

# make sure you understand why this is the total unites
# think about the square matrix above....
Total.units <- length(treat) * length(treat)

# generate some error
error <- rnorm(Total.units, mean = 0, sd = 1)

# make sure you think about where we generated variation in the blocking!
design$obs <- 20 + 
  # the treatment effects
  (design$treat=="Herb1") * 10 + 
  (design$treat == "Herb2") * 9 + 				
  # the latin square blocking effects
  (design$row==1) * 10 - 
  (design$col==4) * 10 + 
  # the error
  error

# look at it....  there are three explanatory variables... 
# treat, row-block, column-block!
head(design)
```

### Fitting the model

Let's fit the naive and full models as before

```{r}
naive_lsd <- lm(obs ~ treat, data = design)
full_lsd <- lm(obs ~ row + col + treat, data = design)
anova(naive_lsd)
anova(full_lsd)
```

Very quickly we can see, again, that without blocking, we have a risk of not detecting differences among treatments!

Take a look above at the `design$obs` object.  Can you review the `summary` output and validate that the model is estimating what we simulated?  You should see the treatment effects (+10, +9) and you should also be able to see the block effects...

```{r}
summary(full_lsd)
```

Finally, we can use contrasts to test a few of our key hypotheses.  Make some notes on what these things mean!

```{r}
#first the set of comparisons with control.  This is the same thing that 
# the summary table does!
contrast1 <- rbind(
  "C v H1" = c(-1,1,0,0),
  "C v H2" = c(-1,0,1,0),
  "C v P" = c(-1,0,0,1))

fit.contrast(full_lsd, "treat", contrast1)

# now the H1 vs H2
contrast2 <- rbind("H1 v H2" = c(0,-1,1,0))
fit.contrast(full_lsd, "treat", contrast2)
```
